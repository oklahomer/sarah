# Provide the same interface as ThreadPoolExecutor, but create only on thread.
# Worker is created as daemon thread. This is done to allow the interpreter to
# exit when there is still idle thread in ThreadExecutor (i.e. shutdown() was
# not called). However, allowing worker to die with the interpreter has two
# undesirable properties:
#   - The worker would still be running during interpreter shutdown,
#     meaning that they would fail in unpredictable ways.
#   - The worker could be killed while evaluating a work item, which could
#     be bad if the callable being evaluated has external side-effects e.g.
#     writing to a file.
#
# To work around this problem, an exit handler is installed which tells the
# worker to exit when its work queue is empty and then waits until the thread
# finish.
